This notebook provides detailed insights into the development and implementation of the churn prediction Big Data machine learning model using the CRISP-DM methodology within the Databricks environment.

## Overview

Churn prediction is a critical business problem with far-reaching implications. Identifying clients who are on the verge of leaving a service or product is essential for proactive customer retention and maintaining loyalty. Many multinational companies now rely on machine learning models, particularly Big Data ML models, due to their capacity to handle vast datasets and uncover intricate patterns.

In this report, we present a churn prediction Big Data machine learning model developed using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology and implemented in Databricks. The goal of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview of the model development process, spanning data preparation and feature engineering to modeling and evaluation.
